    <h1>Flood Risk in Sumner, Washington</h1>
      <h2>Population and Housing</h2>

      <p>The flood hazard in Sumner is mainly focused along the White River that runs through the
      middle of the city. The flood hazard is mainly located in the northern section of the city with smaller
      flood and ponding hazards along the southwest edge of the city. When looking at population density,
      the more people there are the more vulnerable the area is. With most of the population in the southern
      section of Sumner, the south section is vulnerable to flooding (Figure 1). Housing units can be damaged during
      flooding and this makes them vulnerable. Housing unit vulnerability in Sumner is focused in the south
      section of the city, similar to population (Figure 2). Both population and housing units are low in the northern
      section of the city, and therefore less vulnerable.</p>

      <p>The flood risk in Sumner is where the flood hazards and city vulnerabilities overlap. In the south
section of Sumner, along SR-410, there is a flood risk (Figure 3). This area is considered zone AE by FEMA, which
means it is either a floodway or there is a 1% chance every year that this zone could be flooded.
Population density here is between 3 and 4 thousand people per square mile. There are also between
1,500 and 2,000 housing units in this part of Sumner. Additionally, part of SR-410 is within this flood risk
area and could mean the difference between families getting to safety or staying in a life threatening area.</p>
<p>Another risk here is that the wastewater treatment plant is within the AH flood zone (Figure 3). This means there
can be ponding, and this facility is very close to the river and AE zones. The flood risk at this facility
would make the flooding situation even worse with untreated water flooding the city. Although there is
a lot of risk along the southern edge of the city, there are schools and public healthcare facilities that are
not too far away from those in need and with a very minimal chance of flooding, only 0.2% chance every
year (Figure 3). Finally, the north part of the city has a very minimal flood risk, as the flood zones and vulnerable
communities do not coincide.</p>

    <p class="small"><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The flood Zones in Sumner seem to be close to the river, leaving a majority of Sumner with a very minimal chance of flooding. Schools, hospitals, and wastewater treatment plants are also shown here, mainly in areas with minimal chance of flooding.</p>

    <p class="csmall"><strong>Chart 1:</strong>The majority of Sumner is made up of Flood Zone X - 500+yr flood. This means that there is a very minimal chance or risk of flooding in 72.1% of land in Sumner.</p>
